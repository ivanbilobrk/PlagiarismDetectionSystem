|----| 				token shorter than label, no bar printed
|-----| 			token exactly as long as label, no bar printed
|------|			token at minimal length for bar to be printed
|--------------|	token much longer than label, padding + bar

		|			token starts after TAB indentation
        |			token starts after SPACE indentation

|        | 			multiple tokens fitting in one line
|   |      			multiple tokens where the labels overlap

|   |    | 			token in the middle is set to previous line -- saved by TokenList::addToken method

|   |    | 			tokens in this line are in reverse order -- that's okay

|					negative column index leads to redundant blank line

	|      |		one line below: column index greater than line length -- beginning printed at last character of the line
           #

|              |	one line below: length of token exceeds line length -- ending bar printed at last character of the line
               #

|					negative length -- no effect

					token with position after EOF is not printed
